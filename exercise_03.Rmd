```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


## 1 Overview 

Today's exercises are about producing plots from models. If you do the Elvis-Nixon example, be sure that your RStudio session has loaded up the course packet project, where the Elvis meets Nixon image can be found.

## 2 Setup

- **Load** the libraries required for the analysis. Create an R code chunk that runs this code:

```{r libraries}

library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
library(gapminder)
library(socviz)

```

## 3 The Midwest data

```{r gss}
midwest
```



## 4 The Elvis-Nixon image


## 5 Produce your answers as an HTML, PDF, or Word document

- Once you've written your code, knit your document.
